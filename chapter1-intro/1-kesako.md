# 1. Introduction to Containers and Podman:  
## 1.1 Software before Containers: Like Sharing Recipes

**It is all about Apps (more precisely Apps distribution) !**  

> Imagine you've just baked the most delicious cookies using a special recipe. You want your friend to taste them too. Instead of giving them the actual cookies, you hand them the recipe. This recipe lists ingredients like chocolate chips, flour, sugar, and eggs.

>Your friend, excited, follows the recipe. But when they make the cookies, they don't taste quite the same. Perhaps they used a different brand of chocolate or maybe their oven temperature was off.

That's how software used to work:

* Sharing Recipes:  
  Before containers, sharing software was like giving someone a recipe. They got instructions on how to set it up, meaning they had to gather all the "ingredients" (software parts) and hope they got them right.  

* Different Kitchens, Different Results:  
  Everyone's computer is a bit different, much like kitchens. Even if two people had the same software "recipe", the final software might behave differently because of those small variations.

## 1.2 Introducing Containers: The Full Cookie Box

>Now, think about a magical cookie box. This isn't just any box. Inside it, there are already baked cookies, a mini-oven to warm them, and even a small cup of milk on the side. Everything is self-contained. You hand this box to your friend, and when they open it, they get the exact same delicious experience you intended. No variations, no unexpected surprises.

That's what containers do for software:  

* Complete Package:  
  Containers don't just share the "recipe" of software. They pack the whole experience - the software, all its dependencies, and even its environment settings.  

* Consistent Experience Everywhere:  
  With containers, software behaves the same no matter where it's run. It's like giving someone the full cookie experience in a box.  

In essence, containers ensure that the delicious "cookie" experience you create is exactly what others get to enjoy, without the hassles of different "kitchen" environments messing things up.
